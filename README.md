# GEP-Learn

A library for explaining machine learning models using Gene Expression Programming.

Currently, two explainability approaches are available:

- Global surrogate model (see `global_surrogate_model_example.ipynb`)
- Counterfactual explanations (see `counterfactual_explanations_example.ipynb`)
